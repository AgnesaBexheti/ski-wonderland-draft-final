          <h2>Burning Calories</h2>
          <p>
            Skiing and snowboarding are great sports for cardiovascular
            exercise. The exercise is ideal as the body has a chance to recover
            after each run, so it’s a form of interval training. It’s not
            unusual for a recreational downhill skier to burn between 300-600
            calories per hour but this is only the time spent skiing, not on the
            chairlift. The ability of the skier or snowboarder also makes a
            difference. An expert skier or snowboarder will have a much more
            efficient technique and consequently burn fewer calories.
            Cross-country skiers burn more calories because they are constantly
            striding across mostly flat surfaces with no breaks for chairlifts.
            Consequently, they can easily burn between 400-875 calories per
            hour.

        <div class="main-col">
          <h2>Boosts Heart Circulation</h2>
          <p>
            Your cardiovascular system carries blood, pumped by your heart,
            all-around your body. It has numerous vital functions including
            carrying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues around the body, as
            well as removing waste products and fighting off invading bodies. It
            is vital the system works efficiently and anything which helps to
            improve the efficiency is beneficial. Skiing and snowboarding are
            strenuous sports, requiring repeated muscle activity, which in turn
            places demands on the heart to provide extra oxygenated blood and
            nutrients. As the cardiovascular system is used more and more it
            becomes increasingly efficient so you can endure a stronger exercise
            for longer. You may notice if you have a cut on your hand that it
            heals a lot quicker if you have been doing lots of cardiovascular
            exercises.

          <h2>Improved Insulin Resistance</h2>
          <p>
            The level of sugar in your blood is controlled by the hormone
            insulin. Insulin is made in your pancreas, and it helps to transfer
            sugar from your blood into the body’s cells. When cells become
            resistant to insulin, through overproduction, the sugar won’t
            transfer resulting in dangerous levels of sugar in the blood.This
            can result in type 2 diabetes, as well as nerve and organ damage.
            Fortunately, the effect is reversible and aerobic exercise, such as
            skiing or snowboarding, is an ideal cardiovascular workout to repair
            the damage.
